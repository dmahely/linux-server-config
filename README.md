# Project Description
_This project is the sixth and final project in the curriculum of Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree._
The Linux Server Configuration project requires using an instance of Ubuntu on Amazon Lightsail, configuring it, securing it and deploying a web application on it. The hosted web application is the [item catalog application](https://github.com/dmahely/item-catalog).

2. Created a new user `grader` and gave them sudo access. 
3. Configured the Uncomplicated Firewall ufw.
4. Installed various packages such as git, sqlaclhemy and Flask.
5. Changed the default SSH port.
6. Installed and configured Apache and PostgreSQL.
